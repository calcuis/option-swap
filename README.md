## Option swap

The provided TypeScript code is a quiz or question-answer type of application with some complex logic for rendering the options based on the state of the "swap" variable.

The main functionality is to render a list of options (e.g., A, B, C, D, E) and display a radio button next to each option. The user can select one of the options, and if the chosen option matches the correct answer ("ans"), a checkmark ("✔️") is displayed next to it.

The key element in the code is the "swap" state variable, which is used to determine the order of the options displayed. The "item" variable appears to be an object that contains information related to the quiz question.

The "pickItem" function is called initially using the useEffect hook, and it sets the "swap" state based on certain conditions related to the "item" object. The value of "swap" will be a random number between 0 and 6 (inclusive), depending on the properties of the "item" object.

The code utilizes nested ternary operators and logical conditions to determine the order of the options displayed based on the "swap" value and properties of the "item" object.

The option swapping logic seems to be quite intricate and may be difficult to interpret without knowing the specific structure and properties of the "item" object.
